In R, how do I simulate a dataset for reasons of death caused by diseases categorized by gender?

something like this:

x1     Cancer `Heart Disease` `Liver Disease` `Respiratory Disease` `Aid related`
  <chr>   <dbl>           <dbl>           <dbl>                 <dbl>         <dbl>
1 Male    13976           13235            4768                  3149          1779
2 Female    549             460             172                   166            94

You can simulate a dataset in R using the data.frame() function along with sample() to generate random numbers for each category. Here's how you can simulate a dataset for reasons of death caused by diseases categorized by gender:

R
Copy code
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Number of observations
n <- 10000

# Generate random data
gender <- sample(c("Male", "Female"), n, replace = TRUE)
cancer <- ifelse(gender == "Male", rpois(n, lambda = 14000), rpois(n, lambda = 550))
heart_disease <- ifelse(gender == "Male", rpois(n, lambda = 13200), rpois(n, lambda = 460))
liver_disease <- ifelse(gender == "Male", rpois(n, lambda = 4800), rpois(n, lambda = 170))
respiratory_disease <- ifelse(gender == "Male", rpois(n, lambda = 3100), rpois(n, lambda = 170))
aid_related <- ifelse(gender == "Male", rpois(n, lambda = 1800), rpois(n, lambda = 100))

# Create data frame
df <- data.frame(
  Gender = gender,
  Cancer = cancer,
  `Heart Disease` = heart_disease,
  `Liver Disease` = liver_disease,
  `Respiratory Disease` = respiratory_disease,
  `Aid related` = aid_related
)

# View the first few rows
head(df)
This code will generate a dataset with the specified number of observations (n) and random counts for each cause of death, categorized by gender. Adjust the lambda values in the rpois() function to change the mean values for each cause of death.

I just want one row for male and female each

Apologies for the misunderstanding. If you want just one row for male and female each, you can adjust the code to generate single values rather than vectors. Here's how you can do it:

R
Copy code
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate random data for Male
male_data <- c(
  Gender = "Male",
  Cancer = rpois(1, lambda = 14000),
  `Heart Disease` = rpois(1, lambda = 13200),
  `Liver Disease` = rpois(1, lambda = 4800),
  `Respiratory Disease` = rpois(1, lambda = 3100),
  `Aid related` = rpois(1, lambda = 1800)
)

# Generate random data for Female
female_data <- c(
  Gender = "Female",
  Cancer = rpois(1, lambda = 550),
  `Heart Disease` = rpois(1, lambda = 460),
  `Liver Disease` = rpois(1, lambda = 170),
  `Respiratory Disease` = rpois(1, lambda = 170),
  `Aid related` = rpois(1, lambda = 100)
)

# Create data frame
df <- rbind(male_data, female_data)

# View the data frame
df
This code will create a data frame with one row for male and one row for female, with random counts for each cause of death. Adjust the lambda values in the rpois() function to change the mean values for each cause of death.
